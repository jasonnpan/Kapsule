# Kapsule Cloudinary

<h3> 🎨 Platform for Creatives to Share Art | 🛠️ In Development </h3>

Kapsule is a Pinterest-like platform on which users can upload their images to share with the world.
* Users will assign keywords to photos as they upload them.
* Other users will associate themselves with certain keywords.
* Each day, the application will show them a new small "capsule" of art pieces + photos that describe their keywords.

Pinterest, Tumblr, Instagram, and many other mainstream photo and media streaming platforms flood their users' feeds with "viral" posts based on trends + algorithms, causing a large number of talented, unconventional artists to go nameless for years. Kapsule aims to solve this problem by randomly suggesting feeds to users, to celecrate the art of all creatives.
